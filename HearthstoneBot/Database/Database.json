Once unlocked the player can choose to use Lady Liadrin in place of Uther Lightbringer when playing with a paladin deck.\nRaising any character to level 20 will result in the completion of the related achievement. This includes new characters and characters which were created prior to the promotion; creating a new character is not required. For example, raising a character that was previously at level 19 to level 20 will complete the achievement. However, Character Boosts will not count toward the achievement.[2] \nUnlocking Lady Liadrin is not region-sensitive - unlocking her in World of Warcraft in any region should unlock her in all Hearthstone regions for that account.[3]\nNote that Lady Liadrin is not awarded retroactively; players who already have one or more characters at or above level 20 in World of Warcraft must still raise a further character to level 20 in order to obtain the hero.\nThis promotion is free, and does not require any purchase to complete. Characters can be raised to level 20 using the game's Starter Edition, without spending any money.\nIt is not possible to purchase Liadrin, either with gold or real money.[4]",
